# Advent of Code 2025 in Charly
## 1. December 2025

This year I'm semi-comitting to implementing each [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge
in my [programming language Charly](https://github.com/KCreate/charly-vm).

If you take a look at the [Charly standard library](https://github.com/KCreate/charly-vm/tree/rewrite/src/charly/stdlib),
you will notice the following:

> _It is barren_

The stdlib lacks the vast majority of features that a modern language would normally provide.
Adding all the necessary building blocks to solve the daily puzzles thus becomes part of the challenge.

Because of the compounding effect of this, there might be days where no changes are required, and days
where I'll have to reinvent the wheel to get things running. I might not post every day, only on days where
something interesting has been built.

Each article contains a short summary of how I solved the puzzle and what changes I had to make
to the stdlib or the VM itself.

## Days

- [Day 1](./day1)
- [Day 2](./day2)
- [Day 3](./day3)
- [Day 4](./day4)
- [Day 5](./day5)

You can find the source-code for each daily challenge
[on my GitHub](https://github.com/KCreate/advent-of-code-2025-charly).
