# Skills

I started programming when I was 12 years old. My first language was **Objective-C** and I made a couple of iOS & OSX Apps. One of the Apps I've made [even made it to the OSX App-Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/timer-your-new-timer/id839045488?l=en&mt=12).

I also really like doing design-related stuff with Photoshop.

Today I mainly do Web Stuff. Backend and Front-Side are both areas I'm really interested in. You can check out my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/KCreate) to see what I've done.
