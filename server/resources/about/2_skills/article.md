# Skills

I started programming when I was 12 years old.
My first language was `Objective-C`, with which I made a couple of iOS and OSX apps.
Two of the apps I've made were submitted to the App Store. Sadly they are no longer available
because I cancelled my Developer Program Membership.

Altough I'm more of an engineer than a designer, design is something I always keep in
mind when building something new.

At the moment my main interest is language-design and language-development.
My favorite side-project I'm working on right now, is the interpreter for the Charly
Programming language.

Charly is a dynamically typed, object-oriented programming language
written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)

Take a look at my [GitHub account](https://github.com/KCreate) to see all my other projects.
