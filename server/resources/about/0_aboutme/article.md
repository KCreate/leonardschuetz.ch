# About me

Hello stranger, I'm Leonard Schuetz. I'm a 16y old guy, interested in technolgy and design. Here I write about stuff I've made and what's on my mind. Currently I'm an apprentice at Siemens in ZÃ¼rich / Switzerland.

I'm always intersted in meeting new people with the same interest, so please send me a [mail](mailto:leni.schuetz@me.com) if you have any questions or just want to say hello.

Take care!
