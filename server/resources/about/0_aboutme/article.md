# About me

Hello there, I'm Leonard Schuetz. I'm a 16y old guy, interested in technolgy and design. Here I write about stuff I've made and what's on my mind. Currently I'm an apprentice at Siemens in Zuerich.

I'm always intersted in meeting new people with the same interest, so please send me a [mail](mailto:leni.schuetz@me.com) if you have any questions or just want to say hello.

Take care!
