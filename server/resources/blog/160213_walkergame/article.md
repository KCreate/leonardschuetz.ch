Recently I've been working on a little game written purely in JavaScript. It's a 2D minecraft-inspired game all about building and crafting stuff. And it's multiplayer! 8 players can play the game at the same time, same map and same rules!

It currently has over 15 different blocks, all with different properties and actions. You can build yourself a sword, a rifle, ammunition and even a fully functioning portal gun. It supports crafting, fighting and even player sessions.

What you see above is the little wiki I wrote, that automatically updates itself if somthing in the game changes.
The whole game is written in an object-oriented style and i've tried my best to organize the objects as good as possible.
If you are interested in contributing to the game, feel free to fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/KCreate/walkerGame) and add a new pull request. You can also try a live demo [here](http://leonardschuetz.ch:7217/c/). Sometimes the game may be down so just wait a couple minutes and it should be back on.
