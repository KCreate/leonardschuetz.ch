# DeferedContainerList
## 11. May 2016

A couple of days ago, I released a new component for [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) called [deferedcontainerlist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deferedcontainerlist).

All it does is, it defers the rendering of props changes by a specified delay. Whilst the delay is counting down, it gives the components in question a class also being specified by the developer.

This enables powerful animations, that were only possible with a huge blob of code.

Below is a little screencap:
