# Rhystorante

I recently collaborated with two other people at work in the creation of the website of Rhystorante. Rhystorante is food-truck startup from Zuerich in Switzerland.

The project was assigned to me and two other apprentices who also work at the same company I work at.

I was mainly responsible for the design and programming of the page. It's built with raw PHP and SCSS. Building is done via gulp. You can take a look at the live site here: [rhystorante.ch](http://rhystorante.ch/)
