# Text to Image Converter
## 5. June 2016

I made a little tool that encodes a piece of text into an image. You may use this to send hidden messages or just because it's really cool.

# Example
```bash
curl https://www.npmjs.com/package/txt-png | txt-png -t encode > output.png
```

This will produce an image that looks like this:

![no-smooth small](%%PATH%%/output.png)

You may check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/KCreate/pngencoder) and on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/txt-png).
