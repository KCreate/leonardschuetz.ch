## Show me code

###### Convert an array to segments
```javascript
const test = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
// [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

test = arrayToSegments(test, 3);
// [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];

test = segmentsToArray(test);
// [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

###### Convert a string to segments with 4 fields
```javascript
const message = "Hello World!";
const segments = arrayToSegments(message, 4, (char) => (
    char.charCodeAt(0)
));
/*
[ [72, 101, 108, 108],
  [111, 32, 87, 111],
  [114, 108, 100, 33] ]
